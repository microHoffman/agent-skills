description: 'Create, update, query, and manage GitHub issues using the authenticated GitHub CLI and GitHub REST or GraphQL APIs. Use this skill when users want to create bug reports, feature requests, or task issues, update existing issues, add labels/assignees/milestones, set issue fields (dates, priority, custom fields), set issue types, manage issue workflows, link issues, add dependencies, or track blocked-by/blocking relationships. Triggers on requests like "create an issue", "file a bug", "request a feature", "update issue X", "set the priority", "set the start date", "link issues", "add dependency", "blocked by", "blocking", or any GitHub issue management task.'

# GitHub Issues

Manage GitHub issues with the authenticated `gh` CLI. Use `gh issue` for
straightforward reads and writes, `gh api` for REST features, and
`gh api graphql` for Projects V2 and other GraphQL-only features.

## Sandbox Handling

Run GitHub CLI operations outside Codex's default sandbox. Commands such as
`gh auth status`, `gh api`, `gh issue`, and `gh pr` need network access and the
user's authenticated `gh` credentials. Integration tokens can fail with
`Resource not accessible by integration` even when the user's local `gh` token
has permission, so use the user's authenticated CLI for permission-sensitive
reads and writes.

When using `exec_command` for these operations, set
`sandbox_permissions: "require_escalated"` with a concise justification and a
scoped `prefix_rule`, for example:

- `["gh", "auth"]` for `gh auth status`
- `["gh", "api"]` for REST or GraphQL calls
- `["gh", "issue"]` for issue commands
- `["gh", "pr"]` for PR comments, review-thread GraphQL helpers, or related PR operations

Do this proactively for GitHub writes and authenticated reads instead of trying
once in the sandbox and retrying after failure.

## Available Tools

Use the narrowest `gh` interface that supports the operation:

| Interface | Best for |
|-----------|----------|
| `gh issue view/list/status` | Common issue reads and repository summaries |
| `gh issue create/edit/close/comment` | Common issue writes when all needed fields are supported |
| `gh api` | REST features such as issue types, sub-issues, dependencies, and advanced search |
| `gh api graphql` | Projects V2, issue fields, and GraphQL-only metadata |

Use `gh api` when a convenience command does not expose the required field.

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Create issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues -X POST -f title=... -f body=...` |
| Update issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} -X PATCH -f title=... -f state=...` |
| Add comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -X POST -f body=...` |
| Close issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} -X PATCH -f state=closed` |
| Set issue type | Include `-f type=Bug` in the create call (REST API only, not supported by `gh issue create` CLI) |

**Note:** `gh issue create` works for basic issue creation but does **not** support the `--type` flag. Use `gh api` when you need to set issue types.

## Workflow

1. **Determine action**: Create, update, or query?
2. **Gather context**: Get repo info, existing labels, milestones if needed
3. **Structure content**: Use appropriate template from [references/templates.md](references/templates.md)
4. **Execute**: Use `gh issue`, `gh api`, or `gh api graphql`
5. **Confirm**: Report the issue URL to user

## Creating Issues

Use `gh api` to create issues. This supports all parameters including issue types.

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Issue title" \
  -f body="Issue body in markdown" \
  -f type="Bug" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

### Optional Parameters

Add any of these flags to the `gh api` call:

```
-f type="Bug"                    # Issue type (Bug, Feature, Task, Epic, etc.)
-f labels[]="bug"                # Labels (repeat for multiple)
-f assignees[]="username"        # Assignees (repeat for multiple)
-f milestone=1                   # Milestone number
```

**Issue types** are organization-level metadata. To discover available types, use:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{ organization(login: "ORG") { issueTypes(first: 10) { nodes { name } } } }' --jq '.data.organization.issueTypes.nodes[].name'
```

**Prefer issue types over labels for categorization.** When issue types are available (e.g., Bug, Feature, Task), use the `type` parameter instead of applying equivalent labels like `bug` or `enhancement`. Issue types are the canonical way to categorize issues on GitHub. Only fall back to labels when the org has no issue types configured.

### Title Guidelines

- Be specific and actionable
- Keep under 72 characters
- When issue types are set, don't add redundant prefixes like `[Bug]`
- Examples:
  - `Login fails with SSO enabled` (with type=Bug)
  - `Add dark mode support` (with type=Feature)
  - `Add unit tests for auth module` (with type=Task)

### Body Structure

Always use the templates in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md). Choose based on issue type:

| User Request | Template |
|--------------|----------|
| Bug, error, broken, not working | Bug Report |
| Feature, enhancement, add, new | Feature Request |
| Task, chore, refactor, update | Task |

## Updating Issues

Use `gh api` with PATCH:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} \
  -X PATCH \
  -f state=closed \
  -f title="Updated title" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

Only include fields you want to change. Available fields: `title`, `body`, `state` (open/closed), `labels`, `assignees`, `milestone`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Bug Report

**User**: "Create a bug issue - the login page crashes when using SSO"

**Action**: 
```bash
gh api repos/github/awesome-copilot/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Login page crashes when using SSO" \
  -f type="Bug" \
  -f body="## Description
The login page crashes when users attempt to authenticate using SSO.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click 'Sign in with SSO'
3. Page crashes

## Expected Behavior
SSO authentication should complete and redirect to dashboard.

## Actual Behavior
Page becomes unresponsive and displays error." \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

### Example 2: Feature Request

**User**: "Create a feature request for dark mode with high priority"

**Action**:
```bash
gh api repos/github/awesome-copilot/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Add dark mode support" \
  -f type="Feature" \
  -f labels[]="high-priority" \
  -f body="## Summary
Add dark mode theme option for improved user experience and accessibility.

## Motivation
- Reduces eye strain in low-light environments
- Increasingly expected by users

## Proposed Solution
Implement theme toggle with system preference detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Toggle switch in settings
- [ ] Persists user preference
- [ ] Respects system preference by default" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

## Common Labels

Use these standard labels when applicable:

| Label | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Something isn't working |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement |
| `documentation` | Documentation updates |
| `good first issue` | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Extra attention needed |
| `question` | Further information requested |
| `wontfix` | Will not be addressed |
| `duplicate` | Already exists |
| `high-priority` | Urgent issues |

## Tips

- Always confirm the repository context before creating issues
- Ask for missing critical information rather than guessing
- Link related issues when known: `Related to #123`
- For updates, fetch current issue first to preserve unchanged fields

## Extended Capabilities

The following features require REST or GraphQL APIs beyond the basic `gh issue`
commands. Each is documented in its own reference file so the agent only loads
the knowledge it needs.

| Capability | When to use | Reference |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Advanced search | Complex queries with boolean logic, date ranges, cross-repo search, issue field filters (`field.name:value`) | [references/search.md](references/search.md) |
| Sub-issues & parent issues | Breaking work into hierarchical tasks | [references/sub-issues.md](references/sub-issues.md) |
| Issue dependencies | Tracking blocked-by / blocking relationships | [references/dependencies.md](references/dependencies.md) |
| Issue types (advanced) | Discovering and updating organization issue types through GraphQL | [references/issue-types.md](references/issue-types.md) |
| Projects V2 | Project boards, progress reports, field management | [references/projects.md](references/projects.md) |
| Issue fields | Custom metadata: dates, priority, text, numbers (private preview) | [references/issue-fields.md](references/issue-fields.md) |
| Images in issues | Embedding images in issue bodies and comments via CLI | [references/images.md](references/images.md) |
